## Introduction



- Restaurants can use food order management to give takeout or delivery services to their customers.

- This C project for a Food Ordering Management System is an application written in the C programming language. This small C programming project is about food orders and calculating the bill based on the quantities ordered.


## Research


### Objective

A complete sales channel for the restaurant is provided through an online ordering and delivery system. This means that the restaurant can use it to increase profits and improve organizational efficiency.


### Benefits

The user can choose from the availability of the dishes that are displayed on the menu. After the choice the program can generate the total bill amount which the user needs to pay during the checkout.


## Cost and Features

- The cost for implementing a project involving the total food order amount generation is minimal.


## Defining Our System
- Moving on, this mini c programming project focuses on food orderings and their particular bill calculations depending upon their quantities.

- All the controls fall upon the keyboard keys with help of alphabetical and numerical as the system will instruct you to enter an alphabet or numerical as you proceed further into the system application.

- Presenting a new simple project containing large numbers of menu data and different prices of each for bill calculations, yet a knowledgeable one for learning purposes. The users can change the features of this Mini food ordering system project as per their needs and requirements.
